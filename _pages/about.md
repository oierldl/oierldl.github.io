I am an Assistant Professor of Natural Language Processing in [IXA NLP Group](http://ixa.eus), part of the [HiTZ Centre](http://www.hitz.eus/en/nlp) of the [University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU)](http://www.ehu.eus).

My research focuses on creating NLP models for information extraction that are efficient on under-resourced languages and scenarios. This includes investigating cross-lingual methods, weak supervision, multi-task learning as well as prompt learning techniques with Large Language Models. Iâ€™m also interested on building multimodal that able to learn grounded representation, and I have done some research on building models for educational motivations such as automatic short answer grading. 

Previously, I was a [Ikerbasque](https://www.ikerbasque.net/) postdoctoral fellow at The Natural Language Processing Group at the University of Edinburgh ([EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/)), where I worked on probabilistic unsupervised relation extraction. Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of the Basque country in the IXA NLP Group, working on domain adapation of word sense disambiguation models.
